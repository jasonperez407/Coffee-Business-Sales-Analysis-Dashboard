### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "coffeeOrdersData.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning, formatting, and building the dashboard


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What countries have the highest sales?
- Who are the top customers?
- What are the peak sales periods?


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steady over the past 3 years, with noticeable peaks during the Spring season.
2. Medium roast coffee is the best-performing roast type across all coffee blends regarding sales revenue.
3. The United States significantly outperforms the UK and Ireland regarding sales revenue.
4. Loyalty members spend more on coffee on average than non-members.
5. Non-member customers still account for more than 50% of total sales revenue globally. 

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting medium roast coffee blends.
- Implement a membership marketing strategy or offer seasonal promotions to recruit new loyalty members.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

The source data only covers the years 2019-2021. Current data is needed to assess the company's performance as of 2024. The dashboard does not provide total sales revenue by coffee blend. Timeline visualization is blotchy, due to certain coffee blends not being purchased for longer periods of the year.
